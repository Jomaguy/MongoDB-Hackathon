Implementation Roadmap

- Execute class balance augmentation [X]

Target: Achieve 45-55% class balance ratio

Validation: t-SNE visualization of augmented feature space

- Implement view-angle invariance []

Metric: Cross-view accuracy delta < 5%

Tool: FiftyOne's embedding similarity matrix

- Temporal phase integration []

Outcome: 3x granularity in error detection

Validation: Phase-specific confusion matrices
